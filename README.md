# ft_ls
<!---This project is made mainly for fun and just for basic knowledge<br />
sooo yeah... also I warn you, the code I have written here is quite disappointing as I wasn't experienced in programming at all back then<br />
It doesn't follow norm and probably has a lot of leaks and bugs, please understand --->
The project focuses on recoding the most used shell command "ls".

<br />

## About
It contains recoded system command "ls"<br />
Amongst the numerous options available I have created the following
- `-l`
- `-R`
- `-a`
- `-r`
- `-t`

The overall display, depending on each option, stayed as identical as possible to the system command

<br />

## Setup
```
$ git clone <repo>
$ cd <repo>
$ make
$ ./ft_ls [option] [argument]
```
(path argument is optional)
