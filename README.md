# ft_ls
This project made me recode the command "ls". This project is made mainly for fun and just for basic knowledge. It doesn't follow norm and probably has a lot of leaks :D

<br />

## About
1. It contains recoded system's command "ls"

2. Amongst the numerous options available I have created the following
- `-l`
- `-R`
- `-a`
- `-r`
- `-t`

3. The overall display, depending on each option, stayed as identical as posible to the system command

<br />

## Setup
```
$ git clone git@github.com:kamilprzybyl/ft_ls.git
$ cd ft_ls
$ make
$ ./ft_ls [option] [argument]
```
